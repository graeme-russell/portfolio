Examples of my data analytics and coding skills.

## NottsEye

Developed computer vision software using physics and MATLAB scripting skills; produced an actionable report with commentary for further development, earned a commendation from faculty members.

This script recreates ball-tracking sporting technologies by recording a short video from two webcams and identifying a "ball-like object" using machine learning tools. Optical and classical physics is then used to infer the position of the ball in three dimensions.

## ESRScript

Initiated review of data analysis methods, saved 1000+ hours by automating key processes and training two undergraduate assistants and one faculty member in custom-made data visualization MATLAB script.

After traveling for a scholarship and noticing a needlessly manual process for data analysis, I took it upon myself to write this script. It performs a unique signal averaging process for multiple data sets and identifies key chemical physics features of the final result to calculate the variable of interest.

## LPAScript

Reviewed 50+ articles on statistical modeling methods used to identify leadership styles in preliminary research for facultyâ€”confirmed validity of reviewed methods by generating and analyzing data in R.

This proof-of-concept script shows that latent profile analysis (LPA) can be used to identify hidden subgroups within a data set. It generates a time-series of three groups of distinctively correlated variables, performs a linear regression on that time-series, and finally performs LPA, which correctly identifies the three groups.

## Fortune Most Admired Web Scraping Project 

Work smarter, not harder. Automated the tabulation of publically available fortune's most admired list, including archived data from 2011 onwards.

This project required two scripts, both had to be slightly modified each year due to different sources. archives.r iteratively takes data from a table for each letter of the alphabet, including the URL for more detailed information. webscrape.r then takes the URL and scrapes for the required information.
