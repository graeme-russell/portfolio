Examples of my data analytics and coding skills.

## NottsEye

Developed computer vision software using physics and MATLAB scripting skills; produced an actionable report with commentary for further development, earned commendation from faculty members.

This scipt recreates ball-tracking sporting technologies by recording a short video from two webcams and identifing a "ball like object" using machine learning tools, optical and classical physics is then used to infer the position of the ball in three dimensions.

## ESRScript

Initiated review of data analysis methods, saved 1000+ hours by automating key processes and training 2 undergraduate assistants and 1 faculty member in custom-made data visualization MATLAB script.

After traveling for a scholarship and noticing a needlessly manual process for data analysis I took it upon myself to write this script. It performs a unqiue signal averaging process for multiple data sets and identifies key chemical physics features of the final result in order to calculate the variable of interest.

## LPAScript

Reviewed 50+ articles on statistical modeling methods used to identify leadership styles in preliminary research for faculty. Confirmed validity of reviewed methods by generating and analyzing data in R.

This proof-of-concept script shows that latent profile analysis (LPA) can be used to correctly identify hidden subgroups within a data set. It generates a timeseries of three groups of distinctively correlated variables, performs a linear regression on that timeseries and finally performs LPA which, after observing fit statistics, correctly identifies the three groups.
